# Nature Runecraft Utilities - 1.1.0
This plugin swaps the achivement diary cape left click option to teleport to Jarr (Desert) or Sir Rebral (Falador) when standing at any altar for quick banking. Nature altar is the only altar configured on by default, use the options to select or deselect other altars. it also offers support for abyss runecrafting, which swaps the left click to wilderness (near the abyss entrance) when standing at either Jarr or Sir Rebral.

In particular, use menu entry swapper to swap left click to teleport to Kaleb Paramaya (Karamja - Shilo) - then you can left click teleport back and forth from the nature altar. For other altars you will need to find a different teleport back to the altar (if not using the bayss route).
